We help you organize, research, and articulate your best ideas to turn them into compelling posts or articles that you can publish with confidence.

PROBLEM:

Most AI tools would only help you produce low-quality content
The internet is being flooded with AI-generated content. Countless blog posts, articles, and social media updates, all optimized for marketing or SEO purposes, but devoid of original thinking.
Meanwhile, genuine thought leaders like you are not sharing all the insights you could be sharing because you have high standards. You don't always find the time you would need to prepare a well-researched, well-articulated article for every single idea that comes to your mind. As a result, your readers are missing out on great content, and you are not optimizing your impact.
We've talked to many writers who tried to overcome this challenge using AI, but they all had a similar experience. They played with ChatGPT, Claude and a few other AI tools to try and save themselves some typing, do their research faster, or to reorganise their arguments. But the AI tools they tried were essentially wasting their time because the output failed to meet their standards. Below are some of the common issues people encounter with current AI writing tools.
They make you lose control: Current AI tools are like overenthusiastic editors who completely rewrite your article when you just wanted to rephrase a sentence. Ask for a small edit, and you'll get an entirely rewritten section that loses your carefully crafted arguments. Worse still, each regeneration creates a completely new version with no memory of your previous iterations or the reasoning behind your choices. You end up trapped in a frustrating cycle where you either accept the AI's direction and lose your original vision, or spend more time fixing its overreach than writing it yourself.
They sanitize bold ideas: Your provocative arguments and unique perspectives get watered down into safe, vanilla content that could have been written by anyone. Instead of amplifying your distinctive voice, these tools systematically strip away everything that makes your thinking special.
They fragment your focus: Rather than supporting your natural writing flow, they force you into a pattern of generating, editing, regenerating, and fixing. Each interaction breaks your concentration, making it harder to maintain the deep thinking needed for complex ideas.
They provide deceptive feedback: Current AI tools offer generic praise and surface-level suggestions that create a false sense of confidence. Unlike real readers who challenge your assumptions and spot genuine gaps in your argument, AI feedback rarely pushes you to think deeper or seek out valuable human perspectives. You end up with a polished-looking piece that hasn't truly been tested against real-world understanding.
We're building something fundamentally different, designed specifically for deep thinkers, with a focus on quality, creativity and genuine human collaboration.

SOLUTION:

A new interface leveraging AI agents to serve as your personal editorial team
Imagine having an entire team of specialized AI agents working together to support your writing process. Your AI research assistant processes relevant papers and sources in the background, making intelligent connections to your arguments. Your AI co-author suggests structural improvements while preserving your unique voice. Your dedicated AI fact-checker searches the web for you to verify claims and find references in real-time. Meanwhile, your AI critique strengthens your arguments by considering the multiple perspectives that your readers might hold.
Our AI solution will actively help increase the amount of human feedback that you will seek and receive before publishing content. This is because one of your AI agents will serve as a feedback coordinator, helping you ask the right questions when seeking inputs, then collecting these inputs and helping you transform them into actionable insights.
If our tool was designed poorly, getting a lot of input from people or agents could sometimes be counterproductive, because it would feel overwhelming and distracting, but this is one area where we are investing a lot of our technical resources. Unlike current AI tools that provide shallow, immediate responses, our system thinks a lot more deeply before suggesting changes to make sure they are consistent and valuable. Under the hood, we'll achieve this by leveraging the reasoning capability of modern AI models (the same type of capabilities that are used to solve mathematical problems or coding challenges).
But what we're building is not just a smarter AI model, and it's not just a list of specialized AI agents. We're also designing a new interface from scratch to put you firmly in control. Write however and wherever inspiration strikes, whether you're typing on your laptop, dictating on your phone during a walk, or capturing quick thoughts on the go. Our interface adapts to your workflow, not the other way around. It stays out of your way when you're in flow, but is ready to provide intelligent support exactly when you need it, in a way that enhances rather than disrupts your creative process.
